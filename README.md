# Statistics and Data Science

This project contains multiple tasks that I worked on for the module "Statistik und Data Science" (_statistics and data science_) in my Computer Science bachelor's program.

## Major Tasks

- **Text Classification:**  
  Implement a Bag-of-Words model using scikit-learnâ€™s CountVectorizer and a Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish Metal lyrics from non-Metal.

- **Regression Analysis:**  
  Use a multivariate linear regression on the [Honda City dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho) to predict selling prices based on year built and kilometers driven.

- **Statistical Simulations:**  
  Simulate dice rolls and process casino data to analyze distributions and sample means, and visualize results with matplotlib.

- **Hypothesis Testing and Additional Analyses:**  
  Perform hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests) and other experiments to explore differences between sample groups and various statistical properties.

## Setup and Execution

1. **Installation:**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib scipy
   ```
   
2. **Running the Tasks:**  
   Execute the Python files directly. For example, to run the text classification task:
   ```bash
   python blatt2/aufgabe3.py
   ```
   Other tasks can be run similarly.

## Datasets Used

- [Honda City Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho) for Multivariate Linear Regression
- [Song Lyrics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateibejan/multilingual-lyrics-for-genre-classification) for Text Classifier
- [Pokemon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon)
- Casino Data (provided by our tutors)
